# Financial Multi-Agent System

This project uses the `agno` framework to create a multi-agent system capable of analyzing financial data and conducting web searches. It includes two specialized agents:

- **Web Agent**: Searches the web for information using DuckDuckGo.
- **Finance Agent**: Uses Yahoo Finance to retrieve company financials, stock prices, analyst recommendations, and company info.

The agents are orchestrated as a team to collaboratively analyze companies like Tesla, Nvidia (NVDA), and Apple, and provide investment suggestions for long-term strategies.
